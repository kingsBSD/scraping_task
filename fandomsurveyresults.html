<h1>Fanfiction Questionnaire Results: Fandoms</h1>
<h2>Q2_13: Which fandoms or what type of original amateur fiction do you <em>read</em>?</h2>
<p><table border='1' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='0'>
<tr><td>Star Trek, Stargate, Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Gundam Wing, X--Files, Lord of the Rings</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Buffy/Angel, Harry Potter, Forever Knight, Andromeda, Highlander (currently in a Horsemen-only phase), some 'older' anime every now and then (slayers, weiss kreuz, fushigi yuugi, video game)</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>I will read GEN fic in all of the fandom that I like. I read only GEN in Lord of the Rings, and Kung Fu: The Ledgend Continues.  &lt;br /&gt;I read SLASH (in addition to GEN) in the following: Gundam Wing, Yu Yu Hakusho, Highlander, Smallville, Dogma, Pirates of the Carribbean, Star Trek TOS, Star Trek TNG, Stargate SG-1, The Matrix, The Vampire Chronicels, Xena and Hercules (but only about the gods), and X-Men.&lt;br /&gt;I read HET (in addition to GEN) in the X-Files fandom. I do not read X-Files slash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, many fandoms tend to swing wildly out of character in fanfiction. For example, Lord of the Rings and Gundam Wing. I DO NOT read anything that strays too far out of character, so when fandoms start to 'age' and get filled up with people who don't know much about the characters (often they only know about the characters from fanfiction, having seen very little, if anything, of the actual shows) I tend to drift away rather than search through piles of crappy, OOC fic to find one good one. </td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr><td>I read mainly in the Harry Potter fandom, sometimes Lord of the Rings, and other fandoms if the mood strikes me. If I've just seen a movie, for example, I might go out and search for some fanfiction for it. For original fiction, I prefer urban fantasy and magical realism...I like some degree of familiarity with the world. I don't prefer reading about completely different worlds. What type of fanfic do I read? That also depends on my mood - if I feel angry or depressed, I might read angsty fic to vicariously explore the emotions; if I want something cheerful, I'll read a sweet romantic story; if I'm feeling curious, I'll read some things I haven't read before, like kink. I'm usually happy to try a long and very well-written story, one that isn't cliche, or that uses cliches in a completely different way (thus making the story non-cliche.)</td><td>1</td></tr>

Where book fandoms are concerned, I will only read fiction in a fandom where I've read the book(s).  I regularly read fiction in the Harry Potter, LotR, X-Files, Buffy/Angel, and Star Trek fandoms.

<tr><td>Original m/m fiction - romantic darkfic and romantic angstfic, mainly historical fantasy. I've recently begun writing contemporary leather (BDSM) stories that have more of a gayfic feel to them, though I also post them at slash lists. And I have written two literary slash stories (Arthurian and Dante's Divine Comedy). I also write original gen fiction, but I usually market that to publishers rather than post it online immediately. (I also try to market as much of my m/m fiction as possible, but there aren't many markets for it.)</td><td>1</td></tr>
